                <p style="margin-top: 5px;">by Dahlia Voidquill</p>
                <p style="font-size: 19px;">
                  A spacer — deck officer — launches himself down the<br>
                  steel corridor and disappears up the ladder shaft.<br>
                  The drives are louder than cannons, the snap of their ignition<br>
                  piercing like a thunderclap directly against one's ears,<br>
                  the great plume too searing the eyes of any unlucky<br>
                  sailor that happened to gaze upon the nozzle.<br>
                  <br>
                  An alarm sounds, one of twenty that each of the crew<br>
                  have memorised, the minute difference in length or tone<br>
                  dictating the actions one may take to save their life.<br>
                  The hull shudders, and the meaning of the<br>
                  red lights above becomes painfully apparent.<br>
                  <br>
                  But another sound rings throughout the cold metal,<br>
                  undulating, writhing, splaying itself across the colours of<br>
                  patriotism and supposed valor.<br>
                  <br>
                  But this war does not carry ideals,<br>
                  it is not fought for glory nor conquest,<br>
                  but because it must be fought.<br>
                  <br>
                  A steel panel is torn away, a great purple tendril<br>
                  casting it to the depths of the blue.<br>
                  A sailor ripped from his pseudo-home,<br>
                  down to Hale, where mercy shall never grace his<br>
                  soul once more.<br>

                  "This poem is believed to have been written during one of the key assaults on The One that took place at the planet of HaleE2 in the atk-07 system. It is unknown which ship she was present on, however her vague description of the significance of its colours suggests that is was likely a recognisable Federation craft. It is also unknown exactly why she was present on this ship, however our leading theory is that she was assigned to the mission with the express intent of documenting the experience of fighting the Symbiotes."
