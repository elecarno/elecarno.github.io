I live in parallels,
and all the sunlight shines in my mind.
I live in polygons,
and all the streetlights glow in the day.

Why can’t I stay?
How these fake eyes are so,
Wonderful.
Now would you say, say.
Flower’s bloom where I stay.

Floating islands,
with shrines to this unreality.
Swirling skies,
with glittered thoughts raining down on me.

I live in parallels,
I live amongst these illusions.
Seas of infinity,
false divinity.
I live in parallels,
let the sunlight be true.
Let the sunlight be true.
