Shimmering flower,
walk with me.
This is the hour,
come quick you’ll see.

Stand in golden light,
where you might take flight.
Or burn away,
send the ash astray.

Don’t leave me here,
this fire is yours.
Don’t rise above,
my hand is frail.

I know I lost myself,
but forgive this mind.
I know it's foggy but,
the water’s clear.

Shimmering flower,
walk with me.
This is the hour,
come quick you’ll see.

Stand in golden light,
where you might take flight.
Or burn away,
send the ash astray.
