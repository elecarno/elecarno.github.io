Nothing there to drain,
hollow since the start.
Frail foreign body,
a pilot in the dark.

No expression without a medium,
amplify what's there.
So hope for a catalyst,
to carry thoughts away.

Fragile shell,
hunger for a heart.
Blood and bone,
prison to the truth.

Empty artist,
searching in the ink.
For a coffin,
to raise from the brink.

Stumbling over memories,
on the road to reclamation.
Caught between livelihood and understanding,
with nothing much to keep me going.

Fragile shell,
hunger for a heart.
Blood and bone,
prison to the truth.

Empty artist,
searching in the ink.
For a coffin,
to raise from the brink.
