Twisting trees
and a starry sky.
I wonder what words I could use,
to help me fly.

Broken value,
to not know a thing you're worth.
And share the verses,
that lift us from this Earth, this Earth.

The Poetry Game,
played in the night.
To burn into souls,
and let their minds take flight.

So seek thy lamp,
moth-like mind,
the brightest thing,
you'll ever find.

Till dim it turns,
and far you'll fall,
and then one day,
you'll question all.

But what good are such bleak words?
What good is a cage of your own?
Know that the cage is not you,
know that the fears are not true.

Twisting abyss to the hide the stars,
but nothing can hide the joy you are.
With words forever by your side,
with poems to keep you in the light,

A radiant glow in nothingness,
it's okay to cry; we're not in bliss.
To see the world beyond the isle,
to see what lies just past these trails.

The Poetry Game,
played in the night.
To burn into souls,
and let their minds take flight.

So seek thy lamp,
moth-like mind,
the brightest thing,
you'll ever find.

Twisting abyss,
to the hide the stars,
but nothing can hide,
the joy you are.

Not cloud nor woods,
will mask this heart,
these ailments shall,
be torn apart.
