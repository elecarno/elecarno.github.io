Pain
for the days that he lives,
days that he lives.

Old,
to see the world through her eyes,
world through her eyes.

Friendly ghost,
do you like rainy days?
How about I dance with you?
in a trance with you.

Hallowed ghost,
do you know who you are?
How about I give you a clue?
Just let it come through.

Pieces of your body,
pop in and out of reality.
Milky eyes turn to pitch black,
an abyss that only you can see.

Twirling in the starlight,
hazy figures of our gravity.
A translucent spinal cord,
with memories that I once had.

Shadow of mine,
do you like dark clouds?
Waiting for the sky to cry,
take my hand with teary eyes.

Hauntingly shy,
I guess you are mine.
Live in cold sobriety,
to wait for you to work my mind.

Stories,
that you whisper to me,
whisper to me.

Icy,
are the hands that you give,
hands that you give.

Friendly ghost,
why do you hide from the sun?
I'll pull you into the light,
don't you put up a fight.

Hallowed ghost,
sing me your lullabies.
Put me to sleep,
so that you may weep.

Shadow of mine,
do you like dark clouds?
Waiting for the sky to cry,
take my hand with teary eyes.

Hauntingly shy,
I guess you are mine.
Live in cold sobriety,
to wait for you to work my mind.
