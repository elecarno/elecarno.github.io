Well hey!
This here island is ours eh?

Well brother by mind,
Let's seize this night.
The brain be ticking,
As if it's light.
Oh paddle down streams,
and light the fire,
Well brother by mind,
this night is ours.

I did it again,
I had an idea.
While roaming’ around
this tree right here.

And’ all these lines we’re
Tryna write.
What good are they to this,
Crazy life?

Now we won’t admit,
Cause it's just our bit.
It’ll shadow us,
like that solar eclipse.

So we’ll wait for this here,
and we’ll wait for that there,
but now we can see,
everything’s everywhere.

So hey, what you doin’?
Is it project,
one or two?
and how are you?
Don’t know? That’s fine!
Unsigned? What line?
Wait, how are we working till it's 2AM?
I guess it’s just lemon and cheese, friend!

Well brother by mind,
Let's seize this night.
The brain be ticking,
As if it's light.
Oh paddle down streams,
and light the fire,
Well brother by mind,
this night is ours.

Well brother by mind,
Let's seize this night.
The brain be ticking,
As if it's light.
Oh paddle down streams,
and light the fire,
Well brother by mind,
this night is ours.
The night is ours.
Oh brother by mind the night is ours.
Let's seize this night.
