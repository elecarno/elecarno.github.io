Soft glow,
on the classroom walls.
Fairy lights,
and, a right to dream.

Hold slow,
for the daring will call.
Spend nights,
crafting in printer ink.

Notebooks,
filled with dreary lines.
Fantasy,
Layers and layers of eyes.

Chrysanthemum,
something I heard about.
Oh maybe I'll,
add it to the story.

Coarse hands,
that run through my hair.
Followed myths,
that hammer at my skull.

And everything,
underneath our skin.
I can hold close,
as its cast, to the wind.

Sing along,
to our final verses.
Bring an end,
to the years we could have built.

Old lungs,
for the breath of the young.
We'll go now,
remember that you're strong.

Coarse hands,
that run through my hair.
Followed myths,
that hammer at my skull.

And everything,
underneath our skin.
I can hold close,
as its cast, to the wind.
