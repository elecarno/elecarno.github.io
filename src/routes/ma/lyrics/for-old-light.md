Candlelight flames,
a fire that we have tamed,
for old light I go.

Night stalker's light,
a golden coin in the ink,
for old light I go.

Deadly reprise,
a turntable of emotion,
for new light I go.

Scream in silence,
(a star that burns out),
before it can glow,
(and illuminate the),
paper it burns,
(with cold furious),
hands and a reason,
(to hope for an end)
hope for a -

World of light,
that we might know.
To help us fight,
that enticing glow.
Stars we will burn,
just to make our globe turn,
one more day and a night,
that will freeze our light.
World alright,
that we might hope,
for our light.
