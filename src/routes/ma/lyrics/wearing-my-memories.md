Caught on a windowsill,
draped in gold, burning sky.
Dreaming of life,
what could be, what went by.

A ghostly hand, what never was.
Too late to stay and that's because,
I never saw the world without you,
never gave it another chance.

Wearing my memories,
fake gold and worn out felt.
Symbols for another world,
another world where no cards were dealt.

Where was life was the first choice,
and we never even had to think about,
which side of the light we had to stand on,
which side wouldn't have given us out.

I found myself in white corridors,
with a pain eating at my heart.
I turn around to a hundred hateful eyes,
lie to myself and say I'm all okay.

Then the day goes by and I'm still alive,
hanging on at the edge of a desk,
I tell myself this is where I'll live,
this is where I'll survive.

Where'd my heart go?
Was it even there?
Did I ever know how it
was never in the air?

Who's still here?
How did everybody fair?
I think I know why we're
all in despair.

Round and round, wasn't getting anywhere.
It seemed survival wasn't something I could dare.
Everlasting monologue, monotony to apathy,
tunnel vision, focus to the grave.

To the grave, to the grave, to the grave.
Half-hearted commitment to thought every day,
To the brave, to the brave I could say,
but the pain would never go away.

Where'd my heart go?
Was it even there?
Did I ever know how it
was never in the air?

Who's still here?
How did everybody fair?
I think I know why we're
all in despair.

Caught on a windowsill,
draped in gold, burning sky.
Dreaming of life,
what could be, what went by.

A ghostly hand, what never was.
Too late to stay and that's because,
I never saw the world without you,
never gave it another chance.
