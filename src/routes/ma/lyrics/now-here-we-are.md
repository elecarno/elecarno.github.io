I used to walk
walk down the road
with my head to the ground.
with my head to the ground.

And then I watched,
as one by one
everyone was gone

Faces have passed,
places have passed.
in the shadow of my time.

Now here we are,
four from today,
many tomorrow join the fray.

I used to walk,
walk down the road
with my head in the clouds.
with my head in the clouds.

Now here we are.
Yes here we are today.
We've come a long way.
