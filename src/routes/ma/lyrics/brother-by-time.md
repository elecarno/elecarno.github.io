Oh brother by time,
let the sands flow.
Track your dreams,
let ‘em fly.
Against the shore,
I remember the fields.

Let these connections,
twist and turn,
let these creations,
for a story, I yearn.

Walk with me,
and I, with you.
It's our equation,
hidden crew.

Oh brother by time,
let the sands flow.
Track your dreams,
let ‘em fly.
Against the shore,
I remember the fields.

Brush the grass,
watch your step,
our rocky road,
that we’ll chisel at,
let us see ourselves tower high,
and give hope for Luna.

Oh brother by time,
let the sands flow.
Track your dreams,
let ‘em fly.
Against the shore,
I remember the fields.
