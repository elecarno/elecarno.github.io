Masks are coming off,
looks like our fun is over.
There’s a spanner in the works,
I guess we’ll have to wait for the world.

Oh how will I give back,
After all of this is over?
Like a disappearing act,
I thought that we were sober.

So here you are my kin,
who praised me like a clover.
But soon it will begin,
I thought that we were sober.

We met inside a box,
with walls as big as a mansion.
Yet it came with a cost,
now these walls are our contraption.

There’s clouds in my head,
and skies in the water.
There’s reason in the grass,
and memories in the hills.

It’s the end of the beginning,
I thought we would be winning.
How will we be living,
when its the end of the beginning?

Dots on a map,
vines and rivers on the paper.
This timeline is a forfeit,
We’ll be our own saviour.

Together we’ll run,
through the bracken.
Just like the box,
is what I reckon.

I thought that we were sober

It’s the end of the beginning,
I thought we would be winning.
How will we be living,
when its the end of the beginning?

I thought that we were sober
I thought that we were sober
I thought that we were sober
Cause its the end of the beginning
