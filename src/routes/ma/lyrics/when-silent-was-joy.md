I seem to remember,
that there were stars.
But all it was, was messages,
that cleared a heavy fog.

I didn’t understand,
how that joy felt.
Just like the passing butterflies,
when all was done and dealt.

So I will cry softly,
for when silent was joy.
And hope that I might win the storm,
for that old little boy.
Then I will fall slowly,
like the place that we knew.
And when I reach the bottom,
I’ll find myself anew.

Take the stage from me dear friend,
how will we play this out?
The lights give way for you to shine,
the silence will stand out.

Yet I’m floating in my ignorance,
my lack of reality.
And through it all my head is filled,
and now I can’t forget.

These tunnels I found myself in,
were lifted in mind by all your smilin’.
So I will always remember,
when silent was joy.

I couldn’t foresee
but this is how I fared.
I didn’t think I’d see myself,
falling and so scared.

To a soul you lended,
a long missed kind hand.
But I never saw it through,
and now I understand.

So here’s my melody,
my gift to you.
Some might call it parody,
but some might fall through.

and here amongst the trees I sit,
with my mind against the wall.
Thinkin’ ‘bout the memories,
that glisten while I fall.
