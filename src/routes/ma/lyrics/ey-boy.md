It’s been a while since we walked in this valley together,
ey, boy?
I thought myself a poison to your soul written in,
your red eyes.

And it was only a matter of minds,
till’ our worlds came down and you gave me a line.
Rosy glasses only do so much,
and yours are even more worn than mine.

I’d say we both got a way with words,
oh yours are blunt and mine are fine.
Even so, we’re still so clumsy and I,
gave way for the rhyme.

Shadows walk behind me,
in your stride.
But you picked ‘em up,
and you gave me my side.

Just another little set of words,
to give to a mind,
some are soothing' and,
some are blind.

It’s been a while since we walked in this valley together,
ey, boy?
I thought myself a poison to your soul written in,
your red eyes.

And it was only a matter of minds,
till’ our worlds came down and you gave me a line.
Rosy glasses only do so much,
and yours are even more worn than mine.

Smiles are such a horrid thing when they fade with time.
I don’t know what yours looked like but I’m,
glad I see it now.

Why is it that the sky turns pink,
every time I’m on that road?
Could it be that you’re in the sunset,
perpetual and at prime.

Now our shadows walk together,
walking' away from that era.
Oh and it’s a hell of mark we’ll make,
all along this path we’ll take.

It’s been a while since we walked in this valley together,
ey, boy?
I thought myself a poison to your soul written in,
your red eyes.

And it was only a matter of minds,
till’ our worlds came down and you gave me a line.
Rosy glasses only do so much,
and yours are even more worn than mine.
