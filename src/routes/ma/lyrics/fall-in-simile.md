Listen, listen for the sun.
Give heed to wanderers,
give heed to the flame.
Listen, listen for the sun.

Stand up,
Turn around,
Listen to the moonlight,
and join me on the shore.
  
Cliffs you say?
We got plenty of those.
I’ll fall while we’re in simile,
and float down to the crystal sand.

Fall away,
Fall away.
Your outta my head,
Am I outta yours?

Take my hand,
although I’m shy.
Sail for land,
that we might try.

Irises that I adorn,
or maybe this is how we’re born.
Forge myself a single thorn,
to which I say that I have sworn.

Fall away,
fall away,
fall away,
fall away,
fall away,
fall away,
fall away,
fall away,
fall away.

Stand up,
Turn around,
Listen to the moonlight,
and join me on the shore.

Cliffs you say?
We got plenty of those.
I’ll fall while we’re in simile,
and float down to the crystal sand.

So let our story be told,
let it ring amongst the stars.
Let our minds, be known,
let them stand in history.

Books you say?
We got plenty of those.
I await the day you come with me,
when I lay right here in your company.
