Sunny canopy,
twirling a silver quill,
between my fingers.

Sunlight brushes,
the stray strands of hair,
ornaments of adornment,
swaying in the breeze.

The wind picks up,
and a vestige in memory,
lights up my heart,
so I look to the clouds.

And peering back from,
behind the leaves, does
Luna look with gaily gaze,
and a brightness fill my mind.

Down by the shore,
the cool air fills my lungs,
so I take out my notebook,
to think.

And comes a bird,
to rest upon the loch.
Lightly swiftly on the water,
here's the stories I am after.

Back at home,
sitting by the fire.
Thinking 'bout mortality
and heavenly desire.

Daydream of pages,
that keep my soul alive.
Catching thoughts like butterflies,
and hold them close or die.

Walking down the roads and paths,
and crossings by the streams.
Where new people haven't been,
words bursting at the seams.

And hope to one day find that friend,
that'll keep me on my path.
Maybe even join me,
but I know that's a lot to ask.

I got typewriter hands,
and I'll travel the lands.
Tell the story of the kid,
who saw worlds in people's eyes.

Who flew with crows,
and bound books in gold,
and found love alone,
and not where was told.

I never knew
that such ends might come so soon,
but I've had a lot already,
so I know it's nothing new.

And even though,
it's sad to say goodbye.
I'm glad I did my part,
to help you heal your heart.

And yes it hurts,
but I don't really care,
to try and stitch the strands broken,
is something I won't dare.

So feel no guilt,
feel only the joy,
to live the life that we have now,
there's so much beauty you don't know.

I got typewriter hands,
and I'll travel the lands.
Tell the story of the kid,
who saw worlds in people's eyes.

Who flew with crows,
and bound books in gold,
and found love alone,
and not where was told.

I got stories to tell.
I got stories to tell.
Of birds and books and watery isles,
and catching tears, and trains, and smiles.

The places I have been,
and the people I have seen,
it's worth a read to me,
this I hope that you can see.

I got typewriter hands,
and I'll travel the lands.
Tell the story of the kid,
who saw worlds in people's eyes.

Who flew with crows,
and bound books in gold,
and found love alone,
and not where was told.
