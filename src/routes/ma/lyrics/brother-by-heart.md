Brother by heart,
don’t you see that there’s a tear in your light?
Oh brother by heart,
won’t you come with me into this great life?

I saw you through everything,
but I didn’t stop to think what you might do.
So you said to me, it's all down the drain,
and on this island it’s only the same.

Here we are,
they said you’re dead to us,
and the water’s getting warmer,
so let's hurry up.

Cause these forests, they
won’t hold for long,
and it’s only our mouths,
that’ll sing their song.

Song of our soul,
do you remember that night on the field?
Oh song of our soul,
I swear I knew that I was in the light.

But who are we, to mould these minds,
your crystal’s gone and your heart’s on the line.
I’ll sit with you, by this firelight,
‘till our hopes come back and it’s all alright.

Even though I couldn’t anticipate,
that you would always be around.
I’m thankful for all these nights I would’ve lost.
If you hadn’t helped me run around.

And even though all these thoughts are runnin’ wild,
it’s a life that we have not lost.
So I’ll look towards that island every night,
and see our mark is standing proud.
