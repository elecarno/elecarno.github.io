Mirror world where I reach for the clouds,
place my hand on our heart,
together we will be art.

Kindle the flames that beckon our names,
but time it is not for our part,
lets go back to the start.

Spark on the racing line,
with an imaginary hourglass counting down time.
Flicking through the book of our lives,
it doesn't help that the rain always comes by surprise.

I remember it fondly, I was a lone reflection,
by the silver lake water, into which I looked.
Where I saw you staring, back at me into my soul,
and then the one became two.

Golden friend, lend me your spirit,
give me back my eyes, for them I have merit.
Cold fellow, let me be free,
sing this song and your sight I will give.

Caregiver for this cradle frost,
I see me walking down the river.
The river. The river.

I request that my mind be frozen,
and left in a jar by the field.
The field. The field.

Golden friend, lend me your spirit,
give me back my eyes, for them I have merit.
Cold fellow, let me be free,
sing this song and your sight I will give.
