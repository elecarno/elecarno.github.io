Tell me where the wind blows hardest in the fall,
Dance at the cliffside with me by the fall.
Take me somewhere time will crawl,
grasp the fire of morning's call.

Out the door, through the grass,
tall as trees from a looking glass,
accursed plain, accursed road,
a reality where dreams erode.

Tell me who the shadows warn me of,
how the story will come to a close.
Take me to the place it all began,
a forest home where we had ran.

Ran with our minds or so we thought,
left a trail to the end of the line.
Followed home from the future foretold,
on the night where a hand I did hold.

Tell me where the wind blows hardest in the fall,
Dance at the cliffside with me by the fall.
Take me somewhere time will crawl,
grasp the fire of morning's call.

Take to me the gates of mythology,
tell me about the worlds beyond the "free".
Sing an amber song while I am gone,
I'll sing in ballad while you are gone.

Bring me to the
grounds of those who came before,
the heart of sorrow, of joy, of allure
allure to end of the end of it all.

To see if you are the end of it all,
the time in which we all will fall,
the final cliff I can face with a call,
the face that started the end of it all.

To see if you are the end of it all,
the time in which we all will fall,
the final cliff I can face with a call,
the face that started the end of it all.

To see if you are the end of it all,
the time in which we all will fall,
the final cliff I can face with a call,
the face that started the end of it all.
