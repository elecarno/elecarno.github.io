Looks like I’m through,
chapter two.
And now I’ll go runnin’,
runnin’ with you.

And now I’m alone,
with someone new.
An hour or two,
maybe we’re true.

So we’ll chat every single night,
wishing there was firelight.
But these stories are ephemeral,
cause this is just the interlude.

I’m a severed contact,
dead on contract.
With my heart, so conscious.
How they say, I’m so monstrous.

We’re raised in information.
Overload in conversation.
Maybe I’ll just, stay here pretty,
While you walk off, on a spider lily.

And now I’m free,
from chapter three.
Falling down,
that’s how you sound.

This curse of mine,
it comes with time.
An hour or two,
and we’ll be blue.

This sky’s just you and I,
and the next one down is,
fading slowly, losing hope, telling lies,
just to get some of it back.

So we’ll chat every single night,
wishing there was firelight.
But these stories are ephemeral,
cause this is just the interlude.
