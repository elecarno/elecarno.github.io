Old World,
that I thought I knew.
Dead skin grips to the past,
like a tumour I grew.

Cold shore,
my bones they weep.
For the strength that I had,
when roots my grew deep.

Hallowed past of warm embrace,
forget the fires of such a place.

Your culture flawed, the fragments sewn,
unto my mistakes to which I own.

Yet old world,
dear dead world,
I see you in my dreams.

I need those friendly souls,
and to meet forgotten foes,
so come back to haunt me please.

Symbols I see,
built in my head,
while I was free,
hanging by a thread.

These fires they don't go out,
at least mine don't think they do.
