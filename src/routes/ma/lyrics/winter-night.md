Winter sky,
fire fades.
flowers die,
and here we go again.

Silky snow,
watch the smoke rise from afterglow.
The frost creeps in,
again I must begin.

Poems and notebooks,
and some in my head.

Summation of the year,
before I wish to disappear.

When my mind alights,
and when my spark arrives.

I'll sweep the snow away,
turn my night into day.

Around the fire,
telling stories of what we were.
Never forget the faces,
that helped us feel alive.

But now the embers fade,
and everyone must go home.
To cold of the night,
under faint candlelight.

And faint is my heart,
so remember me please.
Then the darkness creeps in,
and the frost creeps in.

So when I call your names,
to the stars up above me.
I hope you feel the spark alight,
and you have the strength to fight.

Now it's a memory,
just something to forget, something to forget.
Your voice is burned into my skull,
deeper than anyone.

Singed my thoughts,
left them blank.
Feeling like,
I'm in a tank.

And the world swirls around me,
in your wake.
